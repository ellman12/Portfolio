            <p className="mt-8">My name is Elliott DuCharme. I have been working as a software engineer for KBR in Sioux Falls, SD since June 2023. Previously, I interned as a software engineer at Daktronics. I earned my B.S. in Computer Science from Dakota State University, where I studied from August 2020 to May 2023. I was the lead programmer on my high school's FRC team, which led to my love of robotics. My hobbies include archery, cooking, D&amp;D, exercise, gaming, and working on personal projects, usually ones that enhance quality of life. Through several projects over the years, I have developed a love for automation, databases, and game design, as well as a love for learning new technologies.</p>
